    <h1>A Brief History of Rocket Ships</h1>
    <img src="img/rocket-ship.jpg" alt="A picture of a rocket ship" />
    <p>The idea of a rocket up until our modern understanding of the term has changed <strong>drastically</strong> through the ages and it is through the many years of experimentation that we have now <strong>the rockets we know today</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><em>400-ish BC</em>, a Greek gentleman named Archytas made a wooden pigeon fly. Escaping steam propelled the bird suspended on wires.</li>
      <li><em>100-ish BC</em>, another Greek, Hero of Alexandria, invented a similar rocket-like device called an aeolipile</li>
      <li><em>Somewhere in the first century AD</em>, the Chinese developed a simple form of gunpowder</li>
      <li><em>1232</em>, the first reported use of true rockets between the Chinese and the Mongols at the battle of Kai-Keng</li>
      <li><em>13th - 15th centuries</em>, there were reports of many rocket experiments</li>
        <ul>
          <li>In England, a monk named Roger Bacon worked on improved forms of gunpowder that greatly increased the range of rockets.</li>
          <li>In France, Jean Froissart found that more accurate flights could be achieved by launching rockets through tubes.</li>
          <li>Joanes de Fontana of Italy designed a surface-running rocket-powered torpedo for setting enemy ships on fire.</li>
        </ul>
      <li><em>16th century</em>, rockets fell into a time of disuse as a weapon of war, they were still used for fireworks and displays, and a German fireworks maker, Johann Schmidlap, invented the "step rocket"</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>The Science of Rocketry</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><em>1642-1727</em>, the scientific foundations for modern rocketry were laid by the great English scientist Sir Isaac Newton</li>
      <li><em>1720-ish</em>, a Dutch professor, Willem Gravesande, built model cars propelled by jets of steam.</li>
      <li><em>End of 18th century-early 19th century</em>, rockets were briefly revived as weapons</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Modern Rocketry</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><em>1898</em>, a Russian schoolteacher, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, proposed the idea of space exploration by rocket.</li>
      <li><em>Early 20th century</em>, an American, Robert H. Goddard, conducted practical experiments in rocketry.</li>
      <li><em>1923</em>, Hermann Oberth published a book in 1923 about rocket travel into outer space.</li>
      <li><em>1957</em>, Sputnik I, the satellite was the first successful entry in a race for space between the two superpower nations.</li>
      <li><em>1958</em>, Explorer I was launched by the U.S. Army.</li>
      <li><em>1958</em>, the United States formally organized its space program by creating the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</li>
